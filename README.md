# tikz-tutorial

This is a quick startup tutorial for TikZ and PGFplots. It is mostly made of real examples from my published papers and old presentations.
To follow the tutorial, [fork](https://github.com/poldap/tikz-tutorial/fork) this repository, go to your [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/login)
account (or sign up and associate it to your GitHub account) and select `New Project` -> `Import from GitHub` -> `tikz-tutorial`.

The idea is to follow the code in `main.tex` and observe its results on the slides of the tutorial. The level ranges from toy 
examples of the simplest uses to complex TikZ code that has been used to generate high-quality published figures. The document
and all the relevant pieces of TikZ code are commented and will be progressively improved.
